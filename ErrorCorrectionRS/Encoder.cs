    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// A block is defined as the set of data that is ultimately produced by the encoding process, such
    /// as would be transmitted or stored. A block is composed of a string of symbols. A symbol is a single 
    /// value that is an element from the underlying Galois field. A block is split into two parts - symbols
    /// containing original message data, and symbols containing parity data.
    /// 
    /// This implemention assumes a binary Galois field - that is, one of the form GF(2^N).
    /// Since the /characteristic/ of the field is 2, symbols are binary and thus are composed of N bits.
    /// A consequence of the design of finite fields is that the width of each symbol is necessarily
    /// linked to the length of the block.
    /// This implementation defines addition for elements in GF(2^n) as the bitwise XOR operation, 
    /// and multiplication by way of logarithms.
    /// 
    /// The size of the field is the number of elements in the Galois field. GF(2^4) can
    /// also be represented as GF(16), and thus has 16 elements. 
    /// 
    /// The block size produced by Reed-Solomon encoding when using a field GF(2^N) is 
    /// 2^n - 1; GF(2^4) == GF(16) has 15 symbols per block, and each symbol is 4 bits for a total
    /// of 60 bits per block.
    /// The choice of how many symbols are used to represent original data versus parity data 
    /// is a choice of the invoker. The choice of the number of bits per symbol depends on the exponent
    /// parameter of the field size. GF(2^N) has 2^N - 1 symbols per block and N bits per symbol. Thus
    /// a block has N * (2^N - 1) bits.
    ///
    /// This implementation is compatible with "code shortening" schemes where a block of N symbols
    /// is filled with some number of zeros, parity is computed, and only the original and parity 
    /// chunks are transmitted. This implementation, however, does not perform any of the work to 
    /// implement code shortening; it is the responsibility of the invoker to do so if desired.
    /// 
    /// BlockSize 
    ///     - the number of symbols that is ultimately produced by the encoding process.
